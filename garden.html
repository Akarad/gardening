    <h1>HOME GARDEN</h1>
    <p>My partner and I share a common interest which is gardening. He however seems to have a greener thumb that I do. Lets take a brief walk through what type of plant variety you will find in my home garden</p>
    <h2>BAMBOO</h2>
    <p>This plant thrives everywhere except in cold climates.The origins of the plant can be traced to <strong>China</strong> where the first ever use of bamboo in every day use was recorded. It's been proven that this plant is strong enough for construction too. Just be sure to treat the bamboo to ensure it lasts long</p>

    <h2>LEMON BONSAI</h2>
    <p>As you know by now, my focus is on home gardening. A great plant to bring the "outdoors" inside your home is the bonsai plant. The origin of bonsi can be tranced to <strong>China</strong>. The plant however spread fast through to Korea and Japan. I recently started growing my own lemon bonsai and will soon look into taking up pottery classes so that i can make my own pots. </p>
